# Write

This section describes how to animate text that was created in the [previous step](how-to/write.md).

---

1. Select a shape layer in the timeline and navigate to the Effects tab (if the Effects panel is not visible, open it by going to Window > Effect Controls: Hello, World!),
2. Twirl-down the **Trim** group under the Scribe effect to reveal the **End** property and enter the value of **0**.
3. Click on the stop-watch to record a keyframe
4. In the Timeline panel, move the Current Time Indicator to the end of the composition,
5. Back in the Effects tab: Scribe > Trim > End and enter the value of **100**.

At this point, we have created a write-on animation of the text "Hello, World!". Feel free to change the stroke color and thickness to your liking.
