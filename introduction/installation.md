# Installation

## Script

1. Unpack the archive you have downloaded and copy/paste "Scribe.jsx" into the "ScriptUI Panels" folder:

- Windows: Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects \<version>\Support Files\Scripts
- Mac OS: Applications/Adobe After Effects \<version>/Scripts

2. Enable **Allow Script to Write Files and Access Network** to avoid unnecessary problems while loading the interface. This option is under the **Scripting & Expressions** tab of the After Effects **Preference** panel:

- Windows: Edit > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions
- Mac: After Effects > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions

Once installation is finished run the script in After Effects by clicking **Window > Scribe**.

If you are using After Effects CS3 - CS6, please also make sure to install the Pseudo Effect provided with the package (or download it [here](../assets/Scribe-Pseudo-Effect-Installer.jsx.zip ":ignore")). To do that, simply run the **Scribe Pseudo Effect Installer.jsx** script (After Effects > File > Scripts > Run Script File ... > Scribe Pseudo Effect Installer.jsx) and follow on screen instructions.

## Fonts

1. Click on the **settings** button in the [main interface](interface/main.md) and navigate to the **General settings** section.
2. Click on the **Install new fonts** buttons and select json files you downloaded with the package (or download them [here](../assets/fonts.zip ":ignore")).

> By default, font files are installed in the **/Scribe fonts** folder under the user's Documents folder. You are free to change this path anytime you like.
